This is a project developed out of intuition of understanding how a code editor can function in browser and to observe
the advantages it can gain rather than desktop applications.As things are shifting to cloud in a very fast way , the
people who are providing it to all should also get the advantage of cloud.

## Aim

This project has the following aims:-

1. Create a secure browser based code editor.
2. Allow the code synchronization among various devices.
3. Provide a fast code editor with speed almost similar to native code editors
4. Provide a realtime output window.

## Goals Achieved

1. A code editor in browser with features such as syntax highlighting , code editing , autocompletion
2. A live output screen
3. Storage of code on cloud using Firebase

## Goals Pending

1. Integrate a beautiful terminal.
2. Increase the efficiency of live code synchronization between code editor and live output
3. Convert the REST API to another efficient client for cloud synchronization
4. Improve the UI and UX of the overall website
5. Document the code and clean it.
6. Add Code Splitting and improve async loading.

## Bugs known

1. After typing the cursor automatically moves to the end in the code editor.
2. Session persistence is not working after refresh
